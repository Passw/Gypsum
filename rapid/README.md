## "Rapid Scheme" Libraries

These libraries were originally written by Marc
Nieper-WiÃŸkirchen. These are portable, R7RS-compliant Scheme libraries
that provide basic functionality not specified in the R7RS "small"
langauge specification, or that might be too time consuming to port
from SRFIs to the Scheme implementations that this software targets.

All of these libraries were downloaded from the "Snow Fort" package
repository.
